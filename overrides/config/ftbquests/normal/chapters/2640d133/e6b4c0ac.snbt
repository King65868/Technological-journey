		"Copper can be found in large quantities in bornite veins, alongside iron in pyrite veins, and alongside stibnite in tetrahedrite veins. Several other veins contain copper as a tertiary or sparodic ore, and can be freely mined as you see fit. You'll need lots of copper for bronze, circuit components, and wires. "
