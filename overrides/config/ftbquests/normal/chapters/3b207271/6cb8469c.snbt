		"Gregtech multiblocks have a unique feature, this is the ability to share blocks. All non-functional blocks can be shared between one or more controllers. This allows you to reduce the cost of the more expensive multiblocks.",
		"",
		"If you're a gregtech veteran, you may be confused about why multiblocks take a little bit to form. §c§lWe have a 3 second delay on multiblock forming checks, to reduce late game lag from LCR spam. You can force a check any time by right clicking the multiblock controller with a GT hard hammer. §r If you're looking to increase, decrease, or otherwise alter this please ask in the discord."
